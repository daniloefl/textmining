# textmining

This downloads the front page of different Brazilian newspapers,
cleans them up, removing advertising and navigation bars, and
performs a topical text analysis using LDA or LSI.

This generates graphs showing how strongly related different documents
are connected.

It is configured to download four different news paper first pages:
O Globo, Folha da SÃ£o Paulo, Deutsche Welle and BBC.
BBC and Deutsche Welle are downloaded in their Brazilian versions.

To run it, one must download each day their front page news using:

```
python get_data.py
```

The actual Lattent Dirichlet Allocation analysis is done with:

```
python mine.py
```

It produces an output HTML content that can be saved in a file and seen in a browser.
